Deep Neural Network - Hotel Reviews – Sentiment Analysis

•	Built 3-layer neural network over document vectors where output classifies each document review as (positive/negative) and (truthful/deceptive)
•	Used embedding layer to make the model more interpretable
•	Increased the generalization accuracy of the model by implementing input sparse dropout as Tensorflow’s (dense) dropout layer doesn’t provide out-of-the-box
•	Visualized the learned embeddings using t-SNE
•	Compared Perceptron, Naïve Bayes’s and Neural Network by implementing the first two models from scratch without the use of tensorflow like frameworks.
